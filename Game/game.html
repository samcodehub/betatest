                    <h2 class="mt-5">what are the basic commands code in pygame?</h2>
                    <p class="mt-4">Here are some of the basic commands in Pygame that you can use to get started with game development:</p>
                    <ol class="mt-4">
                        <li class="mt-3">Initializing Pygame: To start using Pygame, you need to initialize it using the <mark><strong>'pygame.init()'</strong></mark> command. This should be the first line of code in your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3 word-break">Creating a window: To display your game, you'll need to create a window using the <mark class="text-break"><strong>'pygame.display.set_mode()'</strong></mark> command. This command creates a window with the specified size and color depth.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Loading images: You can load images in Pygame using the <mark><strong>'pygame.image.load()'</strong></mark> command. This command returns a Pygame surface that can be used to display images on the screen.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Drawing on the screen: To draw images on the screen, you can use the <mark><strong>'blit'</strong></mark> method of the Pygame surface. This method takes two arguments: the surface to be drawn and the position on the screen where it should be drawn.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Updating the screen: After drawing on the screen, you need to update the display using the <mark class="text-break"><strong>'pygame.display.update()'</strong></mark> command. This command redraws the entire screen, making your changes visible to the player.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Handling user input: You can handle user input in Pygame using the <mark><strong>'pygame.event.get()'</strong></mark> command. This command returns a list of events that have occurred, such as mouse clicks or key presses.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Playing sound: You can play sounds in Pygame using the <mark><strong >'pygame.mixer'</strong></mark> module. This module provides commands for loading and playing sounds, as well as controlling the volume and playback speed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-4">These are just a few of the basic commands in Pygame. With these commands, you can create simple games, such as Pong or Snake, and build from there to create more complex games.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4">Here are some of the advanced commands in Pygame that you can use to create more complex games:</p>

                    <ol class="mt-4">
                        <li class="mt-3">Sprites: Pygame provides a sprite module that makes it easier to work with multiple objects on the screen. Sprites allow you to group together images and related behavior, making it easier to manage and control the objects in your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Collision detection: You can use the Pygame sprite module to detect collisions between objects in your game. This is useful for games that require objects to interact with each other, such as in platformers or puzzle games.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Animation: Pygame provides commands for animating images, such as moving them across the screen or changing their appearance over time. You can use these commands to create animations for your game, such as character movements or particle effects.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">User interface elements: Pygame provides commands for creating user interface elements, such as buttons, sliders, and text fields. These elements can be used to create menus, dialogs, and other interface elements for your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Advanced sound effects: The Pygame mixer module provides commands for creating advanced sound effects, such as equalization and reverb. You can use these commands to create more immersive soundscapes for your game.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3">Networking: Pygame provides commands for networking, allowing you to create multiplayer games over a network. You can use these commands to create games that allow players to interact with each other in real-time, such as online multiplayer shooters or strategy games.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="mt-4">These are just a few of the advanced commands in Pygame. With these commands, you can create more complex games that include advanced graphics, sound, and user interface elements, as well as networked multiplayer support.</p>

                              <p class="mt-4">PyOpenGL is a cross-platform Python binding to the standard OpenGL libraries, which provide 3D graphics rendering. It is used for creating visual applications, such as games and simulations, or for providing 3D graphics in scientific and data visualization applications.</p>

                              <p class="mt-4">Installing PyOpenGL and running your first application is a straightforward process. Here's how you can do it:</p>

                              <ol class="mt-4">
                                <li class="mt-3">Install PyOpenGL: You can install PyOpenGL using pip, the Python package manager. Open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command:</li>
<div id="code-container"class="bg-dark text-white pt-3 ps-3 pe-3">
<pre>
<code class="language-Python">pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

                                <li class="mt-3">Create a new Python file: Open a text editor of your choice and create a new Python file. You can name it anything you like, for example, "first_app.py".</li>
                                <li class="mt-3">Import PyOpenGL: In your Python file, import the PyOpenGL library using the following line of code:</li>
<div id="code-container"class="bg-dark text-white pt-3 ps-3 pe-3">
<pre>
<code class="language-Python">import OpenGL.GL as gl

                                <li class="mt-3">Initialize OpenGL: Next, you need to initialize OpenGL by setting up a window and a context. You can use any library that supports OpenGL, such as GLUT, Pygame, or Pyglet. Here's an example using Pyglet:</li>
<div id="code-container"class="bg-dark text-white pt-3 ps-3 pe-3">
<pre>

    gl.glVertex2i(window.width // 2, window.height)
    gl.glEnd()
  
pyglet.app.run()
